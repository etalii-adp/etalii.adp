# ADP terminology

The words ADP uses for what it offers, and what each one means. This file is the single source of these definitions (spec [002, naming convention alignment](../specs/002-naming-convention-alignment/naming-convention-alignment.spec.md)); the Notion page "ADP terminology" and the site's pages `/adp/docs/terminology/` and `/adp/docs/specification-and-definition/` repeat it and point here. A change to a definition is made here first, and the others follow in the same change.

## Tools

ADP offers new ways to visualize, enter and interact with data, mostly text-based. Each of them is a **tool**, and every tool is of exactly one of three kinds.

| Kind | What it is | The test | Examples |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Diagram** | A visual arrangement of elements and the relations between them. | Are elements connected to each other? Then it is a diagram. | Mind map, Wardley map, C4 container diagram, causal loop diagram |
| **Designer** | A form-based visual layout. More than text input, and not a diagram, because nothing in it is connected. | Is it laid out visually, with nothing connected, and filled in rather than typed? Then it is a designer. | None yet |
| **Editor** | A way of working in which typing text is the core interaction. | Is typing text the main thing the user does? Then it is an editor. | Markdown editor, plain text editor |

Apply the tests in the order editor, diagram, designer: a text format that is also drawn (a Mermaid file, for example) is a diagram when the user works in the drawing, and an editor when the user works in the text.

"Tool" replaces "designer" wherever all three kinds are meant: "ADP's tools", "the tool catalogue", "a tool type". "Designer" now means only the second kind.

## Specifying and defining tools

A **tool engineer** specifies how one tool type functions and looks, in its kind's **specification language**. The tools users then create of that type are stored in its kind's **definition language**. There is one of each per kind:

| Kind | Specification language | Extension | Definition language | Extension |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Diagram | DISL, Diagram Specification Language | `.dis` | DID, Diagram Definition Language | `.did` |
| Designer | DESL, Designer Specification Language | `.des` | DED, Designer Definition Language | `.ded` |
| Editor | EDSL, Editor Specification Language | `.eds` | EDD, Editor Definition Language | `.edd` |

- A **specification file** (`.dis`, `.des`, `.eds`) holds one tool type as a tool engineer specifies how it functions and looks: for example, what a state machine diagram's elements and relations are and how they are drawn.
- A **definition file** (`.did`, `.ded`, `.edd`) holds one diagram, designer or editor a user created of such a type: for example, one particular state machine.

DISL and DID have content; DESL, DED, EDSL and EDD are placeholders until a designer or an editor needs them. DID here always means ADP's Diagram Definition Language, not the W3C's Decentralized Identifiers.

History: DEDL became DISL and DID. What was one language, DEDL 0.1, holding both a language definition and the documents made with it, is now DISL (the specification of a diagram type) and DID (a stored diagram). The acronym DEDL is retired and has no current meaning; files, schema addresses and links in its old form are still read or redirected as DISL or DID. Specification files were named after their language (`.disl`, `.desl`, `.edsl`) until 2026-09-30, when they took `.dis`, `.des` and `.eds`, because a file holds a specification, not the language; `.disl` files are still read.

## Tools whose model is another tool's file

Many tools do not store their model in a definition file of their own: the model is a file that belongs to another tool as much as to ADP, such as a Structurizr workspace, an Azure Pipelines YAML file or a Freeplane mind map. FBL, the **Format Binding Language** (`.fbl`), describes how such a file is read and written, and serves every kind of tool.

- **Binding**: an FBL declaration of how one file format maps to a tool type's model in both directions: which files it claims, how elements, relations and attributes are read, and how each change is written back.
- **Body**: the file or folder that holds a document's model when that model is another tool's file. The body is the model's only store; ADP never keeps a second copy of it.
- **Splice**: one minimal, named replacement of a range of bytes in a body. Every edit a user makes is written as one or more splices, and everything outside them stays byte for byte as it was.
- **Reading**: one tool type's view of a body. One body can have several readings open at once, such as six C4 diagram types of one Structurizr workspace, and they share one model and one undo history.
- **Folder subject**: a body that is a folder rather than a file, such as a Helm chart, recognised by the files in it and watched for changes.
- **Persistence plugin**: code that reads and writes a body in a format FBL cannot declare, under the plugin contract FBL defines.

## Related terms

- **Tool type**: one particular tool ADP offers, such as the Wardley map; by kind a *diagram type*, *designer type* or *editor type*. Identified by its **origin**, `<vendor>/<type>`, for example `wardley/map`.
- **Tool engineer**: the person who specifies a tool type in a specification language. Not a "designer", which is a kind of tool, and not an "author".
- **Document**: one piece of content a user works on with a tool, such as one Wardley map. Where a host registers documents, its **registration file** (`.adp`) names the origin on its first line; for a document whose model is another tool's file, it also names the body and keeps the positions the user placed (FBL, section 8). For a diagram built on DISL, the stored form of the document is a DID definition file.
- **Module**: the code package in a host that implements one or more tool types of one kind: a *diagram module*, *designer module* or *editor module*.
- **Host**: an IDE that ADP's tools run in: standalone, IntelliJ, VS Code or Eclipse.
- **Runtime**: the software in a host that loads a specification file and lets users create and change definition files with it.
- **Canvas**: the surface a diagram or a designer is drawn on.
- **Finding**: the result of evaluating a rule or reading a model, such as a broken constraint, an unreadable entry or a duplicate id. It has a severity (error, warning, info or hint) and says where it is: an element, a source location in a file, or a subject that is not drawn. DISL 0.1 called it a *problem*.
- **Display name**: the one name of a tool type, spelled and capitalised the same in every host, the catalogue, the site and Notion. It is a name, not a description: "Mind map", not "Mind map (radial/hierarchical, single central topic)".

## Retired uses

| Retired | Use instead |
|---|---|
| "designer" for any tool, or for all tools ("ADP designers", "the designer catalogue", "Designers" settings) | tool, tools, tool catalogue; or the kind, when only one kind is meant |
| "designer" or "author" for the person who writes a specification ("language designer") | tool engineer |
| "diagram" for any tool, or for all tools (the "Diagrams" database, "diagram type" for an editor) | tool; or the kind that applies |
| "editor" for the running diagram or designer ("diagram editor", "editor runtime", "a designer is an editor") | the kind (diagram, designer); the software that runs specifications is a runtime |
| DEDL, Diagram Editor Definition Language, `.dedl`, `dedl.schema.json` | DISL for a diagram type (`.dis`, `disl.schema.json`); DID for a stored diagram (`.did`, `did.schema.json`) |
| DIFL, DEFL, EDFL, DIDL, EDDL and their extensions; `disl.disl` | earlier drafts' names: use the tables above |
| `.disl`, `.desl`, `.edsl` for a specification file | `.dis`, `.des`, `.eds`: the file holds a specification, not the language |
| "diagram, designer and text editors", "diagram and text designers" | tools: diagrams, designers and editors |

## Exceptions

These keep their names:

- **Platform APIs**: IntelliJ's `FileEditor`, `FileEditorProvider`, `TextEditorWithPreview` and tool windows, VS Code's custom editors, Eclipse's editor extension points. An ADP tool is *shown in* a platform editor; it is not called one.
- **Third-party names**: product, standard and file-type names are never changed, such as "draw.io diagram", "Mermaid class diagram", OMG Diagram Definition and the W3C's DID.
- **Controls**: a property-value or inline label control may be called an editor inside code that is clearly about controls.
- **History**: commits, merged and closed pull requests, published release notes, completed Spec Kit features and spec-workflow archives.
- **Old persisted identifiers**, only where they are still *read* for compatibility after being renamed (an old extension, settings key, schema address or URL), and the legacy fixtures that prove it; they are never written again.
